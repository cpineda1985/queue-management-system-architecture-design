# Queue Management System (QMS) - Design Proposal

## 1. Introduction

This document presents the software architecture design of a Queue Management System (QMS) intended to optimize the client service flow within organizations that require structured, real-time attention management. The solution facilitates ticket generation, queue administration, priority management, performance metrics monitoring, and real-time insights.

Designed with flexibility and scalability in mind, this QMS adapts to various industries such as banking, healthcare, government, and private sector organizations. It aims to improve customer experience, operator efficiency, and data-driven decision-making.
